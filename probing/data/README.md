# Edge Probing Data

**TODO(all):** please document data-preparation scripts in this file! Add one or more sections for the tasks that you processed, describing how to produce the JSON data from the standard / distributed versions of the base datasets. Be sure to include:

- Links to the public / LDC versions of the raw data (so that an external user 
  can repeat this from scratch).
- Scripts and instructions to run them on the raw data to produce the edge 
  probing JSON files.
- A reference for the dataset that includes split information (# of 
  examples in train/dev/test, etc.)

Let's put all the scripts in this folder (`jiant/probing/data`) so we don't clutter up the main `src/` directory.

Following the final expt scripts for the other subgroups, just push a commit to this branch with your documentation & scripts, and we'll merge everything as a single PR at the end of the week.
